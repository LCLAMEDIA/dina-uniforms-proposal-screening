"INSTRUCTIONS FOR PRODUCTMAPPING SHEET:
- This mapping table converts product codes to customer names and controls how their orders are processed. This is for ACTIVE CUSTOMERS you still work with.

How to use this table:

- 'Code' column: Enter the product code prefix that appears before the first hyphen in ProductNum (e.g., 'CAL-UNIFORM-001' ? 'CAL')
- 'CustomerName' column: Enter the full customer name to display in reports
- 'CreateSeparateFile' column:
    Enter 'Yes' to create a dedicated CSV file just for this customer
    Enter 'No' to include them in the main ""OTHERS"" file with everyone else
- 'VendorCleanup' column:
    Enter vendor name (e.g., 'PNW') to keep only that vendor and remove the vendor name from final output
    Leave blank for normal processing without vendor filtering
- 'Description/Notes' column: For your reference only - add any notes you want

What happens to these customers:
- All orders are processed and included in your reports
- Separate CSV files created if you chose 'Yes' for CreateSeparateFile
- Orders appear in reports with the CustomerName you specified
- Vendor filtering applied if VendorCleanup has a value

?? CRITICAL RULES:
- Only put ACTIVE customers here - customers you still work with and want to see in reports
- Do NOT put former customers here - those belong in the BrandCodes sheet to be removed completely
- Every row must have a Code AND CustomerName - don't leave these empty

Examples:
- ? Correct: Put 'GENERIC' here with VendorCleanup='PNW' to filter vendors for sample products
- ? Correct: Put 'CAL' here if Calvary is still an active customer and you want their separate report
- ? Correct: Leave VendorCleanup blank for customers that don't need vendor filtering
- ? Wrong: Put 'CAL' here AND in BrandCodes sheet - this creates conflicts

When to use ProductMapping vs BrandCodes:
- ProductMapping: Current/active customers ? Process their orders and create reports
- BrandCodes: Former customers ? Delete their orders completely

VendorCleanup Examples:
- 'PNW' ? Keep only PNW vendor entries, remove ""PNW"" from vendor names
- 'DINA' ? Keep only DINA vendor entries, remove ""DINA"" from vendor names  
- Blank ? No vendor filtering, process all vendors normally

IMPORTANT: DO NOT list the same customer in both sheets. Moving or changing the header row (Row 2) will cause the program to fail. Keep the structure: Row 1 for instructions, Row 2 for headers, Row 3+ for data.",,,
