## **What this tool does**

The Dina Uniform Proposal Screening tool processes proposal documents from companies seeking a new uniform manufacturer, analyzing these based on client requirements. It:

- Summarizes the focal points of the proposal.
- Provides insights into key items, dates, and costs.


## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the latest version of Python installed on your system. Python 3.6 or higher is required. You can download Python from [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Setting up a Virtual Environment
It's recommended to use a virtual environment for Python projects. This helps to keep dependencies required by different projects separate. To set up a virtual environment, follow these steps:

1. Install the virtual environment package:
```sh
pip install virtualenv
```

2. Navigate to your project directory and create a virtual environment:
```sh
virtualenv venv
```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
   ```sh
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
   - On macOS and Linux:
   ```sh
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

Continuing from where we left off, I'll add the section on installing dependencies and provide brief descriptions for each class based on the filenames you've uploaded. I'll keep the class descriptions general, as I can't inspect the content of the files directly from here.

---

After activating the virtual environment, install the project dependencies by running:

```sh
pip install -r src/requirements.txt
```

This command reads the `requirements.txt` file in your project directory, installing all the necessary Python packages listed there. Ensure you have a `requirements.txt` file that lists all dependencies.
